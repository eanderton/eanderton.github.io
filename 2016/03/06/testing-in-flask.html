    <p>Something that proved harder than it needed to be.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Recently, I undertook a task to investigate how to write robust
unit-tests in Flask.  Specifically, how to interact with the
current <code>test_client()</code> session, and verify its contents.</p>

<p>On the surface, it would appear that the
documentation that surrounds how to write tests is pretty 
self-evident: just copy/paste the examples and let things flow
from there. And this works... <em>most</em> of the time.</p>

<p>Despite my best efforts I found myself coming back to the same 
stumbling blocks over, and over.  Every time I deviated from 
the script in the documentation, I wound up with questions I 
could not answer.  Something had all but disarmed my best 
Google-fu.  Then I figured out why.</p>

<p>First, Flask documentation, while providing a nice narrative, manages
to obscure API pages at every turn.  Inexplicably, they have poor
page ranking <em>and</em> are not always linked on Flask doc pages.</p>

<p>Second, many classes either use some kind of runtime injection, or like
the werkzeug <code>FileUpload</code> class, proxy function calls from <code>__getattr__</code>
to some member value set during <code>__init__</code>. Other times, classes
are added to the namespace at runtime, further hampering <code>pydoc</code>.
So when you finally find the API documentation for a given class,
it may prove useless anyway.</p>

<p>Combined, both of these points foil most attempts to simply look
up the behavior of a given class/type either online or via <code>pydoc</code>.
Neither of these can possibly give the full picture.  You&#39;re left
to either introspect things at runtime, or dig around in the source.</p>

<h2>What to Look For</h2>

<p>First up: when the docs fail you, find salient examples.  Here&#39;s a
decent candidate for Unit-testing:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/examples/minitwit/test_minitwit.py">https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/examples/minitwit/test_minitwit.py</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now my personal preference is for <code>Flask.ext.testing</code> which exposes
a Flask specific <code>UnitTest</code> class for building test suites.  This 
makes for richer tests thanks to all the assertion functions it provides.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this gem:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/testing/#accessing-and-modifying-sessions">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/testing/#accessing-and-modifying-sessions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With many things Flask, the way forward takes advantage of a 
lot of magic, injection, and hidden behavior.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test_client</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">rv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'/'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">flask</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">session</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'foo'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">42</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What&#39;s happening here is that as long as the test_client is in
scope, <code>flask.session</code> gives us whatever session is tied to the
current client <em>on the server side</em>.  When verifying the behavior 
of something like a login URL, this is how we ensure that there
really is a session.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this piece:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">test_client</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">session_transaction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">sess</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">sess</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'a_key'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'a value'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The second <code>with</code> statement here starts a transaction to modify 
the current session <em>ahead</em> of any HTTP activity.  Once the scope 
is closed, the changes are committed to the session.  Strange,
but that&#39;s how the Flask folks set this up.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>From here it&#39;s a matter of experimentation.  The test_client()
is clearly the only game in town, and the examples suggest that
all the typical HTTP verbs are exposed as functions (e.g.
<code>get()</code>, <code>post()</code> etc.).  To this author&#39;s recollection, there&#39;s
no good documentation for this in the API.  Maybe the more 
obscure verbs are exposed, but who knows?</p>

<p>As the rant above explains, it&#39;s not always easy to determine 
what types one is
coding against by just scanning the documentation.  Instead,
runtime introspection (read: logging and interactive debugging)
is crucial to figuring out what is actually going on.</p>
